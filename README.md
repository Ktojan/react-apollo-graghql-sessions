## ABOUT

  I'm Andrey Karpovich (aka Flying Carp), web-developer, and this is my demo app. All data is stored using the Apollo-server, reading and updating handled with GraphQL requests, and frontend is implemented on React (bootstrap based layouts). All stuff is completely random, partially AI-generated. First published: jan 2025.

## Install and run

Run `npm install` in each of folders: root, api and app.
Once that's done, we're going to \api and run server: `npm start`
Then enter to \app and run React frontend app: `npm start` and open http://localhost:1337/ (by default)
GraphQL server is now running at port 4000, so we can access it at localhost 4000/graphql.
