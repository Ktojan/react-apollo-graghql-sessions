## ABOUT

  I'm Andrey Karpovich (aka Flying Carp), web-developer, and this is my demo app. All data is stored using the Apollo-server, reading and updating handled with GraphQL requests, and frontend is implemented on React (bootstrap based layouts). All stuff is completely random, partially AI-generated. First published: jan 2025.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run (yarn, npm etc.):

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
